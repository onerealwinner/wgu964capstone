This was capstone project for my BS degree at WGU.

What drove me to build do this project is a common struggle for parents.  My kids are picky eaters, we struggle finding meals for them they will try to eat.  

So, I built out this concept, that if I had a recipe I know what other similiar recipes can I make.
